# Blanklands Primer

Blanklands is a modular sandbox meant for rapid prototyping: a neutral duchy surrounded by uncharted wilds, with a single fortified town protecting trade caravans and training grounds. The world assumes low magic, modest technology, and grounded stakes so designers can bolt on factions or threats without rewriting the tone. Exploration boundaries focus on the capital square, nearby training grounds, and a ring of mixed forest and cliffs.

## Epoch & Tone
- High medieval infrastructure with glimpses of experimental alchemy.
- Tone balances hopeful rebuilding with simmering danger along the frontier.

## Constraints & Themes
- Factions: City Council, Artisan Quarter, Pilgrim Wardens.
- Civilians value stability; reckless assaults reduce morale headroom globally.
- Heroes should travel light—long expeditions beyond the cliffs require explicit GM approval.
