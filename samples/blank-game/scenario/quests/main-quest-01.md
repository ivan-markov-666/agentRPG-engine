# First Steps

## Summary
Meet the locals, learn the basics, and secure your first small win in the village.

## Story
You arrive at a frontier village where rumors of trouble have begun to spread. The villagers need a quick, low-risk task completed to trust you, and it will point you toward bigger problems.

## Steps
1. Introduce yourself to the village contact in [[default-area]].
2. Investigate the nearby disturbance and return with proof.

## Rewards
- XP: 150 XP for completing the introductory task.
- Gold: 50 gold pieces as a small stipend from the village.
- Loot: A simple token of trust (seal, badge, or charm).
- Social: The village is willing to share rumors and minor discounts.

## Hooks
- The contact hints at a larger threat beyond the village walls.

## Encounters
- A minor confrontation that tests your basic abilities.

## Notes
- Keep this quest short; it is meant to teach the loop: talk → act → report.

## Outcome
- The village recognizes you as a capable helper and reveals the next lead.

## Aftermath
- New opportunity: a follow-up quest can be introduced after this is completed.

## Outcome Hooks
- [[default-area]]: the contact provides a map marker and introductions.

## Conditions
- None (starter quest).

## Fail State
- If you abandon the task, the village withholds information until you prove yourself.
