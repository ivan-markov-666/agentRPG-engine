# Starting Village

## Description
A small frontier village where travelers pass through and rumors travel even faster. It has just enough safety to regroup, but everyone is on edge about recent incidents.

## Points of interest
- The central notice board where small jobs are posted.
- A modest inn that serves as a meeting point for newcomers.

## Connections
- A path toward the nearby fields and woods where the first disturbance occurs.

## Notes
- The village contact watches newcomers carefully and tests their intentions.
- Supplies are limited; gold rewards are small but consistent.

## Conditions
- Entry is open, but locals respond better to respectful behavior.

## Threats
- If the disturbance is ignored, fear spreads and morale in the village drops.

## Connections
- Quest hook: [[main-quest-01]] starts here.
