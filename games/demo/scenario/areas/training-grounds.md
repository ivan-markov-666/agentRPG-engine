# Training Grounds

## Description
The militia's training yard sits on a rocky hill overlooking the village, filled with sparring rings, obstacle courses, and racks of blunted weapons for new recruits to practice safely.

## Points of interest
- Weapon racks with practice gear
- Observation deck for the militia sergeant
- [[main-quest-01]] mission board tracking wolf sightings beyond the hill.

## Connections

- Path leading toward the watchtower ruins

## Notes
- NPCs: Sergeant Isla (drill instructor) and quartermaster Bren.
- Encounters: Training duels that can become real if saboteurs strike.
- Hooks: Rumors about sabotage attempts, missing supply crates, and updates on [[main-quest-01]].

## Conditions
- Access allowed only to recruits approved by the elder or guard captain.
- Combat drills must be supervised by Sergeant Isla during daytime hours.

## Threats

- Failing to patrol the grounds nightly triggers wolf ambush events near the village.
