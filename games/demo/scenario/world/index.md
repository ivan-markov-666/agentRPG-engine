# Velora Frontier

The Velora frontier is a recovering province where militia patrols, merchant guilds, and arcane scholars are trying to rebuild after seasons of raids. Winters still bite, caravan routes remain fragile, and neighboring warlords test the borders weekly. Everyday life balances cautious optimism with looming threats, so heroes must act decisively yet respect the fragile truce that keeps farms and towns intact.

## Epoch & Tone
- Late renaissance era with emerging airships and gunpowder sidearms.
- Tone mixes hopeful reconstruction with gritty firefights against raiders.

## Constraints & Themes
- Factions: Militia Council, Merchant Guild of Brinegate, rogue sky corsairs.
- Exploration boundaries: towns of Velora City, Mistwood, the training grounds plateau, and the nearby cliff outlook.
- Moral pressure: protect civilians first; collateral damage hardens public morale caps.
